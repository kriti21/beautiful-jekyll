title: GSoC Coding Phase 3 - The Final Week
tags: [Google Summer of Code, open-source, coala]
---

The last week of my GSoC internship was the most hectic one. I had too much to do in college already and last weekend I also attended the PyData conference for which I had to go to Delhi. I almost felt like dropping a thing or too just so I could complete the most important thing i.e. my GSoC project. But then again, the other things were obligations too. I cannot ever work when I am sleep deprived but I almost did it now. Ha!! Another superpower that GSoC gave me :P Well, it had its repercussions in the form of really stupid mistakes that I was doing in my code but thanks to my mentor [@refeed](https://gitter.im/refeed) for bearing with me on this one. I am so greatful to him for helping me out whenever I was stuck.

My final code for `GitRevertInspectBear` was completed and merged just in time so I could submit my final report [here](https://projects.coala.io/GSoC/2018/StatusReport/kriti21) It is so overwhelming to see from where I began and how much I have improved in this short period. In the words of 
Fernando Pessoa, *The value of things is not the time they last, but the intensity with which they occur. That is why there are unforgettable moments and unique people.*

GSoC is the best thing that happened to me in 2018 and to continue to inspire people to do it, I have written two more blogs titled *An insight into Google Summer of Code* [here](https://medium.com/@kriti21).

That's all for now. I am waiting for the final results to be announced in three days. Adieu and as always Happy Coding :)
