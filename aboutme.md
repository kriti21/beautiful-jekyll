My name is Kriti Rohilla. I am pursuing my Bachelor's 
degree in Computer Science from [University Institute 
of Engineering & Technology, Panjab University](http://uiet.puchd.ac.in/).

Through my blog, I will be sharing my experience in 
Open Source and coding in general with the goal of 
inspiring readers to get started with the incredible 
world of [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)
